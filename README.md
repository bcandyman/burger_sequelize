### What is Burger?

Burger or "Burgers" is a full stach web application that allows the creation of any burger a person could dream of! Upon thinking of a fun and creative name for your burger, your burger will be added to our database. Once it's in the database, the option will be given to devour this delicious beast of a burger! Burgers created will remain in the ready column so send your friends, maybe they would like a burger also!




### About Burger

Burger is a full stack web application the takes a burger name from a user. Upon burger submission by the user and if the burger name passes the data validation process, the burger name will sent to an SQL database to be recorded. When a burger is created, it will always be saved into the database with the devoured value set to 'false' and will be displayed on the left column of the screen, if the screen is larger than 576 pixels wide. Any burger that has not been 'devoured' will be displayed with a button to allow the user to devour that burger. If the devour button is clicked, the devoured attribute in the SQL database will be changed to 'true' and the page will be re-rendered.
